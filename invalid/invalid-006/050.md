# The probability that proposers receive `Proposal Fee` may be reduced.

## Summary
When proposers propose `Standard Proposal`, they pay `Proposal Fee` to the protocols.
If this `Proposal` is executed, the proposer will be rewarded again.
However, if `StandardGovernor` is `Reset`, the probability of returning fee is reduced by not having `vote` for the proposals in the `Pending` and `Active`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StandardGovernor.sol#propose` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function propose(
        address[] memory targets_,
        uint256[] memory values_,
        bytes[] memory callDatas_,
        string memory description_
    ) external override returns (uint256 proposalId_) {
        uint256 voteStart_;

        (proposalId_, voteStart_) = _propose(targets_, values_, callDatas_, description_);

        // If this is the first proposal for the `voteStart_` epoch, inflate its target total supply of `PowerToken`.
        if (++numberOfProposalsAt[voteStart_] == 1) {
            IPowerToken(voteToken).markNextVotingEpochAsActive();
        }

        uint256 proposalFee_ = proposalFee;

        if (proposalFee_ == 0) return proposalId_;

        address cashToken_ = cashToken;

        _proposalFees[proposalId_] = ProposalFeeInfo({ cashToken: cashToken_, fee: proposalFee_ });

L167:   if (!ERC20Helper.transferFrom(cashToken_, msg.sender, address(this), proposalFee_)) revert TransferFromFailed();
    }
```
As shown in the above `L167` the proposers must pay `Proposal Fee` when they propose.
And it is rewarded when proposal is executed as shown in following `L139`.
```solidity
    function execute(
        address[] memory,
        uint256[] memory,
        bytes[] memory callDatas_,
        bytes32
    ) external payable returns (uint256 proposalId_) {
        // Proposals have voteStart=N and voteEnd=N, and can be executed only during epoch N+1.
        uint16 latestPossibleVoteStart_ = _clock() - 1;

        proposalId_ = _tryExecute(callDatas_[0], latestPossibleVoteStart_, latestPossibleVoteStart_);

        ProposalFeeInfo storage proposalFeeInfo_ = _proposalFees[proposalId_];
        uint256 proposalFee_ = proposalFeeInfo_.fee;
        address cashToken_ = proposalFeeInfo_.cashToken;

        if (proposalFee_ > 0) {
            delete _proposalFees[proposalId_];
L139:       _transfer(cashToken_, _proposals[proposalId_].proposer, proposalFee_);
        }
    }
```

The `ZeroGovernor.sol#_deployEphemeralContracts` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function _deployEphemeralContracts(
        address emergencyGovernorDeployer_,
        address powerTokenDeployer_,
        address standardGovernorDeployer_,
        address bootstrapToken_,
        address cashToken_,
        uint16 emergencyProposalThresholdRatio_,
        uint256 proposalFee_
    ) internal returns (address standardGovernor_, address emergencyGovernor_, address powerToken_) {
        address expectedPowerToken_ = IPowerTokenDeployer(powerTokenDeployer_).nextDeploy();
        address expectedStandardGovernor_ = IStandardGovernorDeployer(standardGovernorDeployer_).nextDeploy();

        emergencyGovernor_ = IEmergencyGovernorDeployer(emergencyGovernorDeployer_).deploy(
            expectedPowerToken_,
            expectedStandardGovernor_,
            emergencyProposalThresholdRatio_
        );

        standardGovernor_ = IStandardGovernorDeployer(standardGovernorDeployer_).deploy(
            expectedPowerToken_,
            emergencyGovernor_,
            cashToken_,
            proposalFee_,
            _MAX_TOTAL_ZERO_REWARD_PER_ACTIVE_EPOCH
        );

        if (expectedStandardGovernor_ != standardGovernor_) {
            revert UnexpectedStandardGovernorDeployed(expectedPowerToken_, powerToken_);
        }

        powerToken_ = IPowerTokenDeployer(powerTokenDeployer_).deploy(bootstrapToken_, standardGovernor_, cashToken_);

        if (expectedPowerToken_ != powerToken_) revert UnexpectedPowerTokenDeployed(expectedPowerToken_, powerToken_);
    }
```
As we see in the above `ZeroGovernor.sol#_deployEphemeralContracts` function, when deploying the new `StandardGovernor`, there is no processing for `Proposal Fee`.
The status of `Proposal` used in TTG includes `Pending, Active, Defeated, Succeeded, Expired`.
If the state is `Expired` or `Defeated`, fee is sent to `DistributionVault` using the `StandardGovernor.sol #sendProposalFeeToVault` function. And if the state is `Succeeded`, you can execute and return the fee to the proposer.

On the other hand, because `PowerToken` has been updated, the old `StandardGovernor.sol` cannot perform `Cast vote` because of the access control modifiers.
Since voting is not available, the processing of `Proposal' in the `Pending` and `Active` states is not done properly, and fee distribution is not done properly.

## Impact
The fee distribution is not exactly done.

## Recommendation
When `Reset Proposal` is executed, we handle fee for proposals in the `Pending` and `Active` states.
