# Faulty Division Operations

## Summary

The developer is using division operations that may lead to rounding errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

While newer versions of the Solidity language support fixed-point mathematical operations, many calculations in Ethereum (including for units of ether itself) are done using integer arithmetic. 

This means that any division operation has the potential to lead to imprecise results in cases where the inputs are variable. 

## Impact

Rounding errors may ultimately lead to unintended calculations and even exploits of smart contract logic as a result.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/libs/ContinuousIndexingMath.sol#L136

```solidity
       uint256 additiveTerms = 84e27 + (9e3 * x2) + ((x2 / 2e11) * (x2 / 1e11));
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/libs/ContinuousIndexingMath.sol#L139

```solidity
           uint256 differentTerms = uint256(x) * (42e15 + (x2 / 1e9));
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/MinterGateway.sol#L526

```solidity
     return _minterStates[minter_].isActive ? (uint256(collateralOf(minter_)) * mintRatio()) / ONE : 0;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/MinterGateway.sol#L903

```solidity
        missedIntervals_ = timeElapsed_ / updateInterval_;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/MinterGateway.sol#L935

```solidity
          return UIntMath.bound112((uint256(principalOfActiveOwedM_) * missedIntervals_ * penaltyRate_) / ONE);
```
