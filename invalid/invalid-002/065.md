# Update Collateral Digest does not conform to EIP-712

## Summary

The Update Collateral Digest does not conform to EIP-712.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the Sherlock's [contest page](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-is-the-codecontract-expected-to-comply-with-any-eips-are-there-specific-assumptions-around-adhering-to-those-eips-that-watsons-should-be-aware-of), it stated that the code is expected to comply with EIP-712. As such, any non-compliance to EIP-712 found during the contest is considered valid.

> **Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?**
> $M is an ERC20Extended token which is ERC20 token extended with EIP-2612 permits for signed approvals (via EIP-712 and with EIP-1271 and EIP-5267 compatibility), and extended with EIP-3009 transfer with authorization (via EIP-712).

Per the EIP-712, the digest to be signed must be in the following format:

> keccak256("\x19\x01" ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(message))

However, the update collateral digest used by the Minter Gateway does not conform to this requirement. The digest does not include the `\x19\x01` and domain separator in the payload to be hashed.

```solidity
File: MinterGateway.sol
958:     function _getUpdateCollateralDigest(
959:         address minter_,
960:         uint256 collateral_,
961:         uint256[] calldata retrievalIds_,
962:         bytes32 metadataHash_,
963:         uint256 timestamp_
964:     ) internal view returns (bytes32) {
965:         return
966:              (
967:                 keccak256(
968:                     abi.encode(
969:                         UPDATE_COLLATERAL_TYPEHASH,
970:                         minter_,
971:                         collateral_,
972:                         keccak256(abi.encodePacked(retrievalIds_)),
973:                         metadataHash_,
974:                         timestamp_
975:                     )
976:                 )
977:             );
978:     }
```

## Impact

The minter gateway relies on the validator signatures to update the user's collateral value. EIP-712 is a standard dictating how to structure and sign data on Ethereum and should be followed closely to ensure compatibility with the EVM ecosystem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the digest adheres to the following EIP-712 format:

```solidity
keccak256("\x19\x01" ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(message))
```
