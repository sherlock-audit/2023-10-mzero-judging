# Using ordered nonces may lead to short-term DoS.

## Summary
Using ordered nonces may lead to short-term DoS.
## Vulnerability Detail
When checking whether the nonce of the signature is valid (to prevent signature replay), a sequential approach was used.
```solidity
    function _checkAndIncrementNonce(address account_, uint256 nonce_) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 currentNonce_ = nonces[account_]++; // Nonce realistically cannot overflow.

            if (nonce_ != currentNonce_) revert InvalidAccountNonce(nonce_, currentNonce_);
        }
    }
```
Using ordered nonces may lead to short-term DoS. There is an easy example: user1 gets the signature with nonce 1, but he doesn't call the `delegateBySig()`. In this time, user2 gets the signature with nonce 2. User2 call `delegateBySig()` but tx revert because his nonce is not the `currentNonce_`. User2 can only call `delegateBySig()` after user1.
## Impact
Users can only call `delegateBySig()` in order, and once a user delays the call, subsequent users are also affected.
