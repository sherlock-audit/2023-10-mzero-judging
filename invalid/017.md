# Wrong number of votes

## Summary
When calculating the total number of votes, the latest value was not obtained.
## Vulnerability Detail
`_castVote()` returns `weight_`, but it gets value before `_castVote(voter_, weight_, proposalId_, support_, reason_);`. It means `weight_` in unchecked is outdate. In the end, `_castVote()` return `weight_`.
```solidity
    function _castVote(
        address voter_,
        uint256 proposalId_,
        uint8 support_,
        string memory reason_
    ) internal returns (uint256 weight_) {
        ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId_);

        if (state_ != ProposalState.Active) revert ProposalInactive(state_);

        unchecked {
            // NOTE: Can be done unchecked since `voteStart` is always greater than 0.
            weight_ = getVotes(voter_, _proposals[proposalId_].voteStart - 1);
        }

        _castVote(voter_, weight_, proposalId_, support_, reason_);
    }
```
It makes the number of votes wrong.
## Impact
All votes are incorrect

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add `getVotes()` again in the end.
```solidity
    function _castVote(
        address voter_,
        uint256 proposalId_,
        uint8 support_,
        string memory reason_
    ) internal returns (uint256 weight_) {
        ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId_);

        if (state_ != ProposalState.Active) revert ProposalInactive(state_);

        unchecked {
            // NOTE: Can be done unchecked since `voteStart` is always greater than 0.
            weight_ = getVotes(voter_, _proposals[proposalId_].voteStart - 1);
        }

        _castVote(voter_, weight_, proposalId_, support_, reason_);
        weight_ = getVotes(voter_, _proposals[proposalId_].voteStart - 1); // fix 
    }
