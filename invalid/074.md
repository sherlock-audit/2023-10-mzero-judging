# Using subtraction in an unchecked block may silently underflow

## Summary

The developer is using subtraction in unchecked blocks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In modern versions of Solidity, arithmetic operations that would underflow or overflow will now revert by default. However, it is possible to obtain the previous behavior where such operations will wrap rather than reverting, by using an unchecked block. 

While arithmetic operations inside such blocks may incur lower gas costs, these blocks should be used carefully, as unintended wrapping behavior may lead to program errors if the developer erroneously believes an operation to be safe.


## Impact

underflow

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        unchecked {
            // NOTE: While `uint256(x) * EXP_SCALED_ONE` can technically overflow, these divide/multiply functions are
            //       only used for the purpose of principal/present amount calculations for continuous indexing, and
            //       so for an `x` to be large enough to overflow this, it would have to be a possible result of
            //       `multiplyDown` or `multiplyUp`, which would already satisfy
            //       `uint256(x) * EXP_SCALED_ONE < type(uint240).max`.
            return UIntMath.safe112(((uint256(x) * EXP_SCALED_ONE) + index - 1) / index);
        }
    }
```

```solidity
        unchecked {
            return uint240(((uint256(x) * index) + (EXP_SCALED_ONE - 1)) / EXP_SCALED_ONE);
        }
```

```solidity
        unchecked {
            return uint144((uint256(index) * deltaIndex) / EXP_SCALED_ONE);
        }

```

```solidity
        unchecked {
            return uint144((uint256(index) * deltaIndex + (EXP_SCALED_ONE - 1)) / EXP_SCALED_ONE);
        }
