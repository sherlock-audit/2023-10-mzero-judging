# Syncing inflation fails to trigger a Transfer event making PowerToken not ERC20 compliant

## Summary

Syncing inflation causes user balance to increase while failing to emit the ERC20 Transfer event.

## Vulnerability Detail

In EpochBasedInflationaryVoteToken.sync, we add unrealized inflation to the balance of the account being synced:

```solidity
function _sync(address account_) internal virtual {
    // Realized the account's unrealized inflation since its last sync.
    _addBalance(account_, _getUnrealizedInflation(account_, _clock()));
}
```

The problem with this logic is that this triggers a balance increase which fails to trigger the ERC20 Transfer event. From the [spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#transfer-1): "A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the _from address set to 0x0 when tokens are created." 

## Impact

The result of this Transfer event not being fired is the inability for event-based indexers to properly track these newly minted tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Emit a Transfer event on sync in the amount of the inflation being realized.
