# active and deactive have unidirectionality

## Summary
Developers divide activity into two variables, making it difficult to accurately determine its true state.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the entire MintaerGateway, once isActive and isDeactivated are set to true, they cannot be modified to false, so have unidirectionality. But when judging whether it is active, these two variables are judged separately. That is to say, if isActive is set to true before and isDeactivated is set to true again, its status cannot be determined.
```solidity
    function activateMinter(address minter_) external {
		...
        _minterStates[minter_].isActive = true;

        emit MinterActivated(minter_, msg.sender);
    }

    function deactivateMinter(address minter_) external onlyActiveMinter(minter_) returns (uint240 inactiveOwedM_) {
		...
        emit MinterDeactivated(minter_, inactiveOwedM_, msg.sender);
        // Deactivate minter.
        _minterStates[minter_].isDeactivated = true;
    }
```
For example, even if a Minter is set to deactive by `deactivateMinter()`, it will return true by `isActiveMinter()`:
```solidity
    function isActiveMinter(address minter_) external view returns (bool) {
        return _minterStates[minter_].isActive;
    }
```
## Impact
Minter's state is chaotic.

## Recommendation
Only use one variable to record minter's state but not two.
