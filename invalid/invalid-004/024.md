# latestIndex can be 0 unexpectedly in an edge case scenario.

## Summary
One of the protocol invariant is that latestIndex will always increase when the function updateIndex is called. If the  function updateIndex is called two times in the same block and let assume the latest rate is changed when calling function updateIndex 2nd time in the same block, then latestIndex will become 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. function updateIndex is called when those function updateCollateral/ mintM/burnM/deactivateMinter are called.so there is possibility of calling function updateIndex multiple times in the same block.

2. Letâ€™s assume currently  latestIndex = 100, latestUpdateTimestamp = 12pm, _latestRate = 0.1%.

3. function updateIndex is called in a block(block.timestamp = 3pm), see function updateIndex( contract ContinuousIndexing), assume latestIndex becomes 101.latestUpdateTimestamp is updated to 3pm.

4. function updateIndex is called again in the same block(block.timestamp = 3pm) and now _latestRate is updated to 0.2%.

5.  function updateIndex( contract ContinuousIndexing) leads to call   currentIndex(), see  function currentIndex,
 ContinuousIndexingMath.multiplyIndicesUp(
                        101,
                        ContinuousIndexingMath.getContinuousIndex(
                            ContinuousIndexingMath.convertFromBasisPoints(_latestRate),
                            uint32(3pm - 3pm)
                        )
 
As     block.timestamp - latestUpdateTimestamp = (3pm-3pm) = 0,                
So currentIndex returns 0 and    latestIndex is updated to 0.


## Impact
As latestIndex becomes 0, so all accounting will be broken.
