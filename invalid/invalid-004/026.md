# If `StandardGovernor.proposalFee` is small or zero, an attacker can asymmetrically gas grief the PowerToken voters and/or prevent them from earning ZeroToken and accruing inflation

## Summary
Power Token holders must vote on all `StandardGovernor` proposals to earn ZeroToken rewards and accrue inflation. If the `StandardGovernor.proposalFee` is small or zero, an attacker can asymmetrically gas grief the voters and/or prevent them from earning ZeroToken and accruing inflation.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible that the `proposalFee` is set to a small value, or even zero. See comment in code block below.
```solidity
    function propose(
        address[] memory targets_,
        uint256[] memory values_,
        bytes[] memory callDatas_,
        string memory description_
    ) external override returns (uint256 proposalId_) {
        uint256 voteStart_;

        (proposalId_, voteStart_) = _propose(targets_, values_, callDatas_, description_);

        if (++numberOfProposalsAt[voteStart_] == 1) {
            IPowerToken(voteToken).markNextVotingEpochAsActive();
        }

        uint256 proposalFee_ = proposalFee;

        if (proposalFee_ == 0) return proposalId_; //This line handles the case of zero proposal fee, in which case the transferring of proposal fee below does not need to happen.

        address cashToken_ = cashToken;

        _proposalFees[proposalId_] = ProposalFeeInfo({ cashToken: cashToken_, fee: proposalFee_ });

        if (!ERC20Helper.transferFrom(cashToken_, msg.sender, address(this), proposalFee_)) revert TransferFromFailed();
```
Furthermore, Power Token holders/delegatees need to vote on all proposals for inflation to be distributed to them and ZeroTokens to be minted, as we can see below.
```solidity
    function _castVote(
        address voter_,
        uint256 weight_,
        uint256 proposalId_,
        uint8 support_,
        string memory reason_
    ) internal override {
        ...
        // NOTE: Will only get beyond this statement once per epoch as there is no way to vote on more proposals than
        //       exist in this epoch.
        if (numberOfProposalsVotedOn_ != numberOfProposalsAt[currentEpoch_]) return;

        emit HasVotedOnAllProposals(voter_, currentEpoch_);

        IPowerToken(voteToken).markParticipation(voter_);

        uint256 reward_ = (maxTotalZeroRewardPerActiveEpoch * weight_) / _getTotalSupply(currentEpoch_ - 1);

        if (reward_ == 0) return;

        IZeroToken(zeroToken).mint(voter_, reward_);
    }
```
Since the Power Token is a governance token and should be decentralized, we can assume that there will be a large number of active voting addresses, such as 100. Therefore, an attacker only has to spend gas to submit one proposal, and then Power Token holders must spend gas to vote 100 times. This is very asymmetrical and makes it very easy for an attacker to grief with a low or zero proposal fee.

If an attacker submits many proposals, Power Token holders (especially smaller ones) may find that it's not monetarily worthwhile to vote on all the proposals. They may decide to delegate their voting power to an address with larger Power Token balance, centralizing voting power.

## Impact
Very asymmetric gas griefing, users won't receive rewards/inflation, users can be disincentivized from voting, voting power may become very centralized which could make it easier for malicious proposals to be passed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Suggest making the `StandardGovernor` a `ThresholdGovernor` so that Power Token holders can ignore spam proposals.
