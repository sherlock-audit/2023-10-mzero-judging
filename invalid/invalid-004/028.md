# Users holding both ````ZeroToken```` and ````PowerToken```` are incentivized to cast ````NO```` votes

## Summary
In current design of ````StandardGovernor````, if a proposal is ````Defeated```` or ````Expired````, ````proposalFee```` would be sent to ````DistributionVault```` and then be distributed to ````ZeroToken```` holders. Otherwise, ````proposalFee```` is paid back to the proposer. The design would incentive users who hold both ````ZeroToken```` and ````PowerToken```` to always cast ````NO```` votes to win ````proposalFee```` from proposers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's investigate the benefits of ````ZeroToken + PowerToken```` holders while casting in ````StandardGovernor````:
1. No matter they cast ````YES```` or ````NO````, they always get ````PowerToken```` (L374) and ````ZeroToken```` (L376\~L380) reward.
```solidity
File: ttg\src\StandardGovernor.sol
352:     function _castVote(
...
358:     ) internal override {
...
373: 
374:         IPowerToken(voteToken).markParticipation(voter_);
375: 
376:         uint256 reward_ = (maxTotalZeroRewardPerActiveEpoch * weight_) / _getTotalSupply(currentEpoch_ - 1);
377: 
378:         if (reward_ == 0) return;
379: 
380:         IZeroToken(zeroToken).mint(voter_, reward_);
381:     }

```
2. Casting ````NO```` increases possibility to make a proposal ````Defeated````, and a ````Defeated```` proposal's fee would be captured to vault (L198). ````ZeroToken```` holders then can claim these fees based on shares.
```solidity
File: ttg\src\StandardGovernor.sol
180:     function sendProposalFeeToVault(uint256 proposalId_) external {
...
184:         if (state_ != ProposalState.Expired && state_ != ProposalState.Defeated) revert FeeNotDestinedForVault(state_);
...
198:         _transfer(cashToken_, vault, proposalFee_);
199:     }

```

Therefore, always casting ````NO```` votes would maximize their return.

## Impact
Voting fairness is affected, proposers might suffer losses.

## Recommendation
No matter the final state of proposal, always sending a fixed portion such as ````50%```` to vault and return the remaining to proposer.
