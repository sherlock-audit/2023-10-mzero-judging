# Cash token will be locked in epoch if no power token holder join to vote epoch

## Summary
Lets assume Alice has 10 percent of power token and in first epoch she doesn't participate in vote epoch part actually Alice's balance is 1000 power token because of this she loses 10 percent of his balance and that goes to dutch auction in next epoch ,Bob buys Alice's power tokens for 1 WETH in second epoch ,already we have 1 WETH in second epoch , also no power token holder participate in vote phase in second epoch and we call distribute function for distribute cash tokens between holders, because of this any zero token doesn't mint in third epoch because we don't have voter in second epoch and because of this anybody cannot claim Bob's cash tokens 
## Vulnerability Detail
please add this function in ttg/test/DistributionVault.sol
```solidity
function test_distributionWithZeroSupply() external {
        // Sets account balances this epoch.
        _baseToken.setPastBalanceOf(_accounts[0], _currentEpoch() - 1, 1_000_000);
        _baseToken.setPastTotalSupply(_currentEpoch() - 1, 1_000_000);

        _baseToken.setPastBalanceOf(_accounts[0], _currentEpoch(), 0);
        _baseToken.setPastTotalSupply(_currentEpoch(), 0);

        // Mint 1_000_000 funds tokens to the ZeroToken contract and distribute them.
        _token1.setBalance(address(_vault), 1_000_000);
        _vault.distribute(address(_token1));

        uint256 startEpoch_ = _currentEpoch();
        uint256 endEpoch_ = startEpoch_;

        _warpToNextEpoch();
        assertEq(_vault.getClaimable(address(_token1), _accounts[0], startEpoch_, endEpoch_), 0);

    }
```


## Impact
Cash token will be locked in epoch if no power token holder join to vote epoch

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think we can add a function to standard governor that can move cash tokens from an epoch to another epoch
