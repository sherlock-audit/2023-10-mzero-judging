# Wrong value of _votingPeriod


## Summary
The _votingPeriod() is a function that Returns the number of clock values between the vote start and vote end. However in both StandardGovernor and ThresholdGovernor this function will always return 0 in StandardGovernor  and 1 in ThresholdGovernor since it is hardcoded, the problem of this is that this is an important value to determine the VoteEnd and with the current implementations the voting and the governance system will not work as it should.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the _votingPeriod() in StandardGovernor:
```solidity
  function _votingPeriod() internal pure override returns (uint16) {
        return 0; //@audit-issue hardcoding the voting period value 
    }
```
For StandardGovernor contract this function is used in BatchGovernor to determine the timepoint at which voting would end given a timepoint at which voting would start.
```solidity
    function _getVoteEnd(uint16 voteStart_) internal view returns (uint16) {
        unchecked {
            return voteStart_ + _votingPeriod();
        }
    }
 ```
This means that the voteEnd will be the same as voteStart_ because the _votingPeriod() will always return 0. The value of voteEnd should not be equal to voteStart because we check if a proposal is valid by verifying if its between voteStart and voteEnd. There is also no function to override this value after deployment.


## Impact
In both contract StandardGovernor and ThresholdGovernor the voting and all governance mechanisms wont work properly because the contract wont be able to determine the voting end since the votingPeriod  is always  0. The ThresholdGovernor is heavily used in ZeroGovernor contract and there is also no way to modify this value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the deployer to setup the votingPeriod in constructor you can also add a function to override and change this value if needed.
