# Quorum Value will always be 1


## Summary
The StandardGovernor is a governance contract, users are able to propose,vote and execute tranasactions when they meet all requirements. However an issue exists with the current implementation since the project hardcoded the value of quorom to be 1, in StandardGovernor contract we can also check BatchGovernor to verify that there is no function to override this value (since StandardGovernor inherits BatchGovernor). The function quorum() which suppose to [returns the minimum number of eligible (COUNTING_MODE) votes for a proposal to succeed at `timepoint`.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/ttg/src/StandardGovernor.sol#L270-L272) gives 1 since its hardcoded as you see in the code snippet.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists since their is no other functions to override this value and the project is not taking into consideration if votes counting reached quorum or no which is one of the most important things in governance contract. To verify this here is the code of the state() function that gives whether a proposal is Succeeded or Defeated. 
```solidity
    function state(uint256 proposalId_) public view override(BatchGovernor, IGovernor) returns (ProposalState) {
        ...
        ..
        if (currentEpoch_ == voteEnd_) return ProposalState.Active;

        if (proposal_.yesWeight <= proposal_.noWeight) return ProposalState.Defeated; //@audit we dont check if the propoposal weight reached the quorum or no 
        unchecked {
            return (currentEpoch_ <= voteEnd_ + 1) ? ProposalState.Succeeded : ProposalState.Expired;
        }
    }
```
When we add both of the issues 1) hardcoding the value of quorum and 2) not taking into consideration if the weight of the votes reached quorum this can lead to users proposing and voting any arbitrary proposal and it will be valid.

## Impact
In this case when someone propose if his proposal got 3 votes in yesWeight and 2 votes in noWeight, this will be a valid proposal because the contract is not implementing the quorum check.  But normally in this case the contract should revert saying the voting count didnt reach the quorum and mark the proposal as defeated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of hardcoding the value of quorum make the deployer set it up in the constructor and in the state function make sure to verify if the weight of the vote is greater tha  quorum, if not we can mark the proposal as defeated.
