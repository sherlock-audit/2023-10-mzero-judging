# Incorrect penalty calculation for missing collateral updates

## Summary
The math formula that calculates penalty amount based on missed intervals is not correct

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_imposePenaltyIfMissedCollateralUpdates` function of `MinterGateway.sol`, it imposes penalty based on currently owed amount of M token and the number of intervals that missed the collateral updates, as follows:
```Solidity
_imposePenalty(minter_, uint152(principalOfActiveOwedM_) * missedIntervals_);
```

In calculation, the penalty amount is calculated by multiplying number of intervals, but this is not correct.
The correct one has to be exponential instead of multiply.

Let's take an example:
Alice owes 100M, penalty rate is 10%, and missed 3 intervals.

When the penalty is imposed after 3 intervals, she pays 30M as penalty. 100 * 3 * 10% = 30
However, assumed the penalty is imposed for each interval, she pays 33.1M as penalty.
[Interval 1] 100 * 10% = 10
[Interval 2] (100 + 10) * 10% = 11
[Interval 3] (110 + 11) * 10% = 12.1

As a result, based on how user updates collateral, penalty amount becomes different, which should not.

## Impact
Less penalty is imposed to users who do not update their collateral in-time.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Penalty amount calculation formula has to be updated as follows:
`PenaltyAmount = OwedM * ((1 + PenaltyRate) ^ Intervals - 1)`
