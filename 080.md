# `PowerToken::buy` can be frontrun

## Summary
The current implementation in `buy` function of  `PowerToken.sol` does not explicitly implement measures to prevent frontrunning. 

## Vulnerability Detail
- The current implementation in `buy` function of  `PowerToken.sol` does not explicitly implement measures to prevent frontrunning. 
```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IPowerToken
    function buy(
        uint256 minAmount_,
        uint256 maxAmount_,
        address destination_,
        uint16 expiryEpoch_
    ) external returns (uint240 amount_, uint256 cost_) {
        // NOTE: Buy order has an epoch-based expiration logic to avoid user's unfair purchases in subsequent auctions.
        //       Order should be typically valid till the end of current transfer epoch.
        if (_clock() > expiryEpoch_) revert ExpiredBuyOrder();
        if (minAmount_ == 0 || maxAmount_ == 0) revert ZeroPurchaseAmount();

        uint240 amountToAuction_ = amountToAuction();
        uint240 safeMinAmount_ = UIntMath.safe240(minAmount_);
        uint240 safeMaxAmount_ = UIntMath.safe240(maxAmount_);

        amount_ = amountToAuction_ > safeMaxAmount_ ? safeMaxAmount_ : amountToAuction_;

        if (amount_ < safeMinAmount_) revert InsufficientAuctionSupply(amountToAuction_, safeMinAmount_);

        emit Buy(msg.sender, amount_, cost_ = getCost(amount_));

        _mint(destination_, amount_);

        // NOTE: Not calling `distribute` on vault since anyone can do it, anytime, and this contract should not need to
        //       know how the vault works
        if (!ERC20Helper.transferFrom(cashToken(), msg.sender, vault, cost_)) revert TransferFromFailed();
    }
```

- the contract does use a modifier `onlyStandardGovernor` to restrict certain actions to the standard governor, which could help mitigate some forms of frontrunning by ensuring that only authorized actions are taken.

## Impact
medium- it can lead loss of funds bc the contract does use a modifier `onlyStandardGovernor` to restrict certain actions to the standard governor, which could help mitigate some forms of frontrunning by ensuring that only authorized actions are taken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the frontrunning does not cause user loss or unexpected problems.
