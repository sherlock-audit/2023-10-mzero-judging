# Lack of nonce in the UpdateCollateralDigest

## Summary

The lack of nonce in the UpdateCollateralDigest allows attackers to replay the signatures to the gateway, allowing them to chain up this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities in the system to drain the Minter Gateway.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is a standard practice to implement nonce to the digest to be signed to ensure that the signature can only be used once and to guard against potential replay attacks. However, it was observed that no nonce was included in the UpdateCollateralDigest.

Without considering other controls in places outside of the `_verifyValidatorSignatures` function, a signature from validators can be replayed and successfully verified by the `_verifyValidatorSignatures` function multiple times.

By chaining up this vulnerability, which allows signatures to be replayed, with other vulnerabilities raised in my other reports, such as the use of minimum timestamps instead of maximum timestamps, attackers can perform more sophisticated attacks that involve reorganizing and replaying signatures to drain the Minter Gateway. Refer to my "Using minimum timestamp across all signatures could drain the gateway" report for more details.

## Recommendation

Consider including the nonce to the digest to prevent the signature from being replayed.
