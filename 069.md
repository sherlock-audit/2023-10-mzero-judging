# infinite function can finish gas and cause DOS

## Summary
the function can run forever and revert any vote  from being registered.

## Vulnerability Detail

this function has a recursive call to it has and has no condition to stop it

```solidity
  function _castVote(
        address voter_,
        uint256 proposalId_,
        uint8 support_,
        string memory reason_
    ) internal returns (uint256 weight_) {
        ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId_);

        if (state_ != ProposalState.Active) revert ProposalInactive(state_);

        unchecked {
            // NOTE: Can be done unchecked since `voteStart` is always greater than 0.
            weight_ = getVotes(voter_, _proposals[proposalId_].voteStart - 1);
        }

@>        _castVote(voter_, weight_, proposalId_, support_, reason_);
    }

```


## Impact
1.can revert when it calls its selfs again, can fish the gas because of an infinite loop and can cast many votes
2. All proposals can fail because cast votes is not working as intended
3. incorrect number of votes can be assigned
