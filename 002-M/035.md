# Unapproved MToken earners can keep earning indefinitely, reducing yield for approved earners

## Summary
Unapproved MTokens earners can keep earning, which reduces yield for approved earners.
## Vulnerability Detail
MToken holders require governance approval to start earning MTokens, and the function to stop holders from earning can only act on `msg.sender`. There's no way to stop an unapproved earner from continuing to earn.

```solidity
    function startEarning() external {
        _revertIfNotApprovedEarner(msg.sender);
        _startEarning(msg.sender);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IMToken
    function stopEarning() external {  
        _stopEarning(msg.sender);
    }
```

The [documentation](https://docs.m0.org/m-0-documentation-portal/overview/whitepaper/ii.-protocol/ii.i-operation/ii.i.v-the-earn-mechanism) states that "If an address is removed from the Earnerâ€™s list, Stop Earning can be called with the address in question passed as an argument to the method." This is not possible in the code.

## Impact
Loss of earnings for approved earners.

## Recommendation
Add a function that can stop unapproved earners from earning.
