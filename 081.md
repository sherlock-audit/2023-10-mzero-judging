# Unsafe downcasting arithmetic operation in MinterGateway.sol:MinM()

## Summary

The value of principalOfTotalActiveOwedM is unsafely downcasted and truncated from uint256 to uint112.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Solidity, as in many other typed programming languages, a developer may (attempt to) cast between types in their code. Solidity offers many variants of certain builtin types at different bit widths (for example, uint8 vs. uint256), and it is possible to cast between these. 

However, a narrowing type cast (from a higher to a lower bit width) may inadvertently truncate bits and cause the value after the cast to not be equivalent to that before the cast. This can lead to inadvertent logical errors in smart contract execution.

## Impact

Performing a narrowing downcast may result in silent overflow due to bit truncation.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-mzero/blob/main/protocol/src/MinterGateway.sol#L310

```solidity
  principalOfTotalActiveOwedM = uint112(newPrincipalOfTotalActiveOwedM_);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Just use uint256, or use openzepplin safeCasting.
