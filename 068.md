# uncheck  subtraction from "principalOfTotalActiveOwedM" and "_rawOwedM[[minter_]"

## Summary
There is unchecked in  _rawOwedM[minter_] and totalInactiveOwedM.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function _repayForInactiveMinter(address minter_, uint240 maxAmount_) internal returns (uint240 amount_) {
        amount_ = UIntMath.min240(inactiveOwedMOf(minter_), maxAmount_);

        unchecked {
            // Treat rawOwedM as present amount since `amount_` would only be non-zero for an inactive minter.
      @>      _rawOwedM[minter_] -= amount_;
      @>      totalInactiveOwedM -= amount_;
        }
    }

 function _repayForActiveMinter(
        address minter_,
        uint112 maxPrincipalAmount_,
        uint240 maxAmount_
    ) internal returns (uint112 principalAmount_, uint240 amount_) {
        principalAmount_ = UIntMath.min112(principalOfActiveOwedMOf(minter_), maxPrincipalAmount_);
        amount_ = _getPresentAmount(principalAmount_);

        if (amount_ > maxAmount_) revert ExceedsMaxRepayAmount(amount_, maxAmount_);

        unchecked {
            // Treat rawOwedM as principal since `principalAmount_` would only be non-zero for an active minter.
       @>     _rawOwedM[[minter_] -= principalAmount_;
      @>      principalOfTotalActiveOwedM -= principalAmount_;
        }
    }
